            The concept of <a class="showup" href="">decoloniality</a> has existed for as long as coloniality (Walsh &
            Mignolo, 2018).
            The two
            are
            so intrinsically intertwined - and despite being suppressed - decoloniality finds itself constantly
            creeping through the gaps of <a class="showup" href="">history</a> and bursting into current affairs. In
            terms of knowledge,
            decoloniality finds itself a necessary opposition to the monetized industry of tertiary education
            across
            the globe, particularly in South Africa.

            ‘Blackness for Sale’ was a 10-day live eBay auction event by composer, and artist, Keith Townsend
            Obadike. In this piece, Obadike, objectified and placed what is his <a class="showup"
                href="">‘blackness’</a> for
            sale on - what was
            relatively still new at the time – an eCommerce site. The online act was removed four days after
            receiving twelve bids while live, being deemed inappropriate by the hosting site (Driscoll, 2020).
            What was initially a comment on the forceful nature of the rising World Wide Web (Croal, 2001),
            became intrinsically <a class="showup" href="">commentative</a> on the interaction between the virtual space
            and black <a class="showup" href="">bodies</a>, as
            well as the intersectionality of sex and gender, and the complexity of blackness’ history (Driscoll,
            2020), and it’s ongoing relationship with coloniality.

            In Miao Ying’s piece, “Blind Spot”, Ying highlights concerns, and comments on the highly <a class="showup"
                href="">censored</a>
            state of accessible internet in her home country China. What started as scholastic research, lead to
            the eventual creation of Ying’s physical, web affected <a class="showup" href="">art</a>dictionary. Ying
            took on the intense task
            of individually searching each word in the dictionary and erasing along the way the words were
            censored and restricted by the country’s local laws. During the making of this piece, Ying aimed to
            place a spotlight on this rigid <a class="showup" href="">policing</a> and the negative effects of the
            state’s laws that are
            perpetuated by communist ideals.

            The prevalence of technology with the shift into the COVID <a class="showup" href="">pandemic</a> has become
            paramount to the
            continuity of the working world, as well as in the means of youth education across the globe.
            However, the pre-existing, and ever expanding, digital <a class="showup" href="">divide</a> presented by the
            vast difference in
            objects of affordances across various countries, has had a tumultuous effect on the already
            <a class="showup" href="">marginalized</a> groups of various backgrounds, creating a need to address the
            lack of access in rural
            communities and disadvantaged minorities.

            The concept of decoloniality, tackled through knowledge, begins with the questioning of the validity
            of
            existing Eurocentric and Westernized <a class="showup" href="">knowledge</a> (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) and
            challenging the
            detachment of
            the known from the knower (Mbembe, 2015). By opening the <a class="showup" href="">geopolitical</a> spheres
            - and accepting the
            pluriversal (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) - that have long been cast aside because of the glorification of
            western beliefs, will allow us to redefine the bounds of knowledge across the globe and <a class="showup"
                href="">cultures</a>,
            and in
            doing so we create a space where coloniality’s effects on the future become less gripping (Walsh &
            Mignolo, 2018).

            Obadike’s online <a class="showup" href="">performance</a> received various responses – some directly in
            question of the piece,
            particularly in terms of the relation of value of his blackness and it’s transferability across
            genders (Croal, 2001). Participants particularly wanted to know what other “perks” were covered by
            the transfer of his blackness, and if there would be considerations to the cost in terms of its
            <a class="showup" href="">intersectionality</a> with sexuality and gender (Croal, 2001). In response,
            Obadike noted that the
            commodification of blackness is heavily influenced by gender – and so too, it would have complicated
            his piece to add in more context regarding these intersections (Obadike, 2001). Obadike also noted
            that the performance’s lack of visual aids, allowed for the piece was able to be fetishized and
            resonated with audiences differently from his other works (Obadike, 2001) – and that with the
            inclusion and regard of gender and sex, the piece would probably not have permeated in the same way
            (Obadike, 2001).

            The existence of ‘Blind Spot’ can be considered an <a class="showup" href="">artifact</a> as it crosses the
            two temporal spaces in
            its finality (Taylor, 2009). The dictionary itself, being a version pre-communist China, and its now
            censored state showcasing the new acceptable <a class="showup" href="">discourses</a> and language. Ying’s
            elaborate address of
            this exploitation of the ideal of upholding the whole of society, also showcases the temporal shift
            from pre- to post-communist China (Net Art Anthology, 2007). However, this <a class="showup"
                href="">shift</a> was not just that
            of the state, but also of the population’s acceptance of these censorship regulation, and what Ying
            refers to as ‘self-censorship’ (ELEPHANT, 2021) – something Ying relates to Stockholm Syndrome.

            Research has shown that adequate internet <a class="showup" href="">access </a>and considering the
            <a class="showup" href="">educational</a> pairing needed for
            this, has more benefits to rural communities, and the countries of these rural
            communities
            (Daniolou, 2020). Not only would internet access create digital spaces for these cultures and
