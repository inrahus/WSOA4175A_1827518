                The concept of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>
                has existed for as long as coloniality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018). The two
                are
                so intrinsically intertwined - and despite being suppressed - <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a> finds itself
                constantly
                creeping through the gaps of history and bursting into current affairs. In terms of knowledge,
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality </a>finds itself a
                necessary opposition to the monetized industry of tertiary education
                across
                the globe, particularly in South Africa.

                The concept of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>, tackled
                through knowledge, begins with the questioning of the validity
                of
                existing <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Eurocentric">Eurocentric</a> and
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Westernize">Westernize</a>d knowledge (Walsh &
                Mignolo, 2018) and challenging the
                detachment of
                the known from the knower (Mbembe, 2015). By opening the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Geopolitical">geopolitical</a> spheres - and
                accepting the
                pluriversal (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) - that have long been cast aside because of the glorification of
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">western</a> beliefs, will allow us
                to
                redefine the bounds of knowledge across the globe and
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Culture">culture</a>s,
                and in
                doing so we create a space where coloniality’s effects on the future become less gripping (Walsh &
                Mignolo, 2018).
                increasing number of unresolved issues caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self
                comes into play, and each person becomes responsible for their own increasing number of unresolved
                issues caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self

                caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self
                However, the colonial matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018), in turn, finds ways to redefine such
                existing knowledge – when presented with its overwhelming popularity and validity - in a way that
                promotes the view of the subjugating power and diminishes the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Culture">culture</a>s/<a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=minority">minorities</a> from which it
                stems.
                The ability of the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=subjagating">subjugating</a>
                power to <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cherry-pick">“cherry-pick”</a> the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=minority">minority
                </a>populations, damages the manner
                of
                addressing the existing validity of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">Western</a> knowledge. It leaves
                those affected by coloniality
                facing an
                endless influx of antagonism without allowing for the past moments of such to be resolved (Mbembe,
                2015). It in turn leaves the individual to address and challenge the colonial power matrix, and in
                doing
                so, creates <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=radicality">radicality</a>.

                In the South African context, and within the tertiary sphere, we saw the fruition of such in the
                2015
                Rhodes Must Fall Movement (Mbembe, 2015). The unresolved and untouched happenings and effects of
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=apartheid">apartheid</a>, which were so
                ill-addressed – and the colonial state of the country, which was so
                glorified –
                toppled over with the Capetonian statue of Rhodes. With the end of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=complacency">complacency</a> – stemming from

                power
                matrix (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a> in
                a increasing number of unresolved issues caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self

                so, there has been a shift in the
                West’s
                power over the colonial matrix of power, and a rise in the unique position of increasing number of
                unresolved issues caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self
                comes into play, and each person becomes responsible for their own<a

                history have allowed for several <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=perspective"></a>perspectives and <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reflection"></a>reflections
                on the approach to <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>.
                Particularly the differences between the opinions of Lorde and Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
                2018).

                Where Lorde believes that true change cannot occur without <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dismantling">dismantling</a> the existing
                matrix of power
                –
                which is now upheld by the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=binaries">binaries</a> of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Race"></a>race, <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sex">sex </a>and <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nature">nature</a>
                (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) – Gordon &
                Gordon
                believe that instead of completely starting over, we should use the existing tools and create from
                them
                a large enough, undisputable <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hegemony">hegemony</a> that overturns the
                matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
                Although contradictory, both these views exist in response to the advancing effects of coloniality
                (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).

                Despite both Lorde and Gordon & Gordon pose valid points, I find that their opinions very detached
                from
                the current African, and South African context.

                Within our context, we find ourselves between <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Radical">radical</a> <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Africanization">Africanization </a>(Mbembe,
                2015), self-righteous
                agreement with the perspective – and no following action - of Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
                2018),
                all while under the rule of the postcolonial middle class who have corruptly <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=assimilated">assimilated</a> colonial
                thought (Mbembe, 2015). Given the working of the colonial matrix of power, and with the
                consideration of
                the unresolved antagonism of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=apartheid">Apartheid</a> and the implications
                of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Africanization">Africanization</a> unto the
                foreigner
                (Mbembe, 2015) – I find it hard to conclude a collective way forward through the repercussions of
                coloniality on this country.

                In the case of the tertiary sphere, the movement of the view of students to consumers, and the shift
                in
                focus from knowledge acquirement to credit acquirement (Mbembe, 2015), the focus on Western
                imitation
                within the African context will only cause more antagonistic results. By moving tertiary education –
                which has now become necessary in permeating the working world created by the capitalistic society
                (a
                result of colonial reach) – to a marketable product (Mbembe, 2015), tertiary institutions in South
                Africa – and globally - hinder the progress of <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>.

                In efforts to correct or steer away from this in the South African context – with the mindset of
                Gordon
                & Gordon – we can, as Mbembe states, “Yes, if we fully embrace our own location in the African
                continent
                and stop thinking in South-Africa-centric terms”. By redefining higher learning and integrating the
                pluriverses of Africa (Mbembe, 2015) into the tertiary sphere as a means of resignification – we can
                nurture a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=holistic">holistic</a> African house
                of thought, with a mastery that transcends the Anglo-American means
                of
                tertiary approach. By unsettling the Western idea of a single temporality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018),
                we
                can engage in a field of knowledge that allows for the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Decolonization">decolonization</a> of the
                self, by the self –
                with a
                means of channeling the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=radicality">radicality</a> that stems from the
                <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Oppressive">oppressive</a> antagonism of the
                results of
                coloniality – not on in South Africa, but on the African continent.

                And although I do not know, yet, how to move forward as a whole country – addressing the higher
                education system in the manner proposed by Mbembe – not only will allow provide the basis for such a
                solution to - but it will also shift the balance of power away from the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">Western</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Eurocentric">Eurocentric</a>
                ideals –
                while also allowing for the knower and known to become more closely related. The focus on
                decolonizing,
                and achieving accessible knowledge will allow for the <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pluriverse"></a>pluriverse to exist, and open
                to
                consideration,
                the positions of different <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Geopolitical">
                    geo-political</a>stances and opinions. And there, we start to
                see how the
                colonial matric of power, begins to fall apart.
