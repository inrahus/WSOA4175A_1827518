                    The Digital Divide
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prevalence of technology with the shift into the COVID pandemic has become paramount to the
                    continuity of the working world, as well as in the means of youth education across the globe.
                    However, the pre-existing, and ever expanding, digital divide presented by the vast difference in
                    objects of affordances across various countries, has had a tumultuous effect on the already
                    marginalized groups of various backgrounds, creating a need to address the lack of access in rural
                    communities and disadvantaged minorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research has shown that adequate internet access and considering the educational pairing needed for
                    this, has more benefits to rural communities, and the countries of these rural communities
                    (Daniolou, 2020). Not only would internet access create digital spaces for these cultures and
                    peoples, but it would also serve well in cases of long-distance emergencies, general ease of
                    communication and with the access to such vast information, the ability to breach gaps of social
                    inclusion and increase community development. However, the impact of the capitalist notions on the
                    pricing of internet access, plays a large role in hindering such developments and the fear of the
                    potential, addressable dangers that come with such an affordance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the article by Daniolou, there is a brief discussion on the benefits and dangers of increasing
                    access to areas that face the ‘rural penalty’ (Daniolou, 2020). Throughout, it is clear to see that
                    most cons to the action of increasing access, can be dealt with adequate education and means to
                    technological literacy. If the introduction of, specifically in this article, broadband is paired
                    with the necessary information on how these systems function and what the capabilities of such
                    technology are, there is a good chance that most of the concerns on misuse, misleading radicality
                    and the dilution of existing cultural practices (Daniolou, 2020), can be addressed and resolved.
                    Thus, the benefits, of which are plentiful, can truly begin to address the widening of the digital
                    divide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tataki and Glynos’ report that with the unprecedented disruptions in the work and school spheres of
                    society, there has been a drastic increase in the digital divide with the lack of access being
                    disproportionately attributed to the most disadvantaged communities (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). Both
                    students and workers affected by the shift to remote learning form part of societal minorities –
                    with the majority affected worldwide being girls and women (Tataki & Glynos, 2020), and those within
                    the US context mostly being from low-income families – who are also a part of the ethnic minorities
                    of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the South African context, we saw this effect in the divide as the increase in job losses
                    (Makgatho, 2021) and COVID deaths across the country forced many families into low-income states.
                    While there was an increasing debate on who to blame, I believe it is not that hard to see how the
                    lack of income and the increasing inflation has forced families, and minors to focus on household
                    supporting, and in turn has directly impacted the highest number of dropouts in twenty years
                    (Makgatho, 2021). Although we are aware of the government’s attempts to breach access barriers by
                    relaying tablets and the like to state schools, we also see how little to no effort has been made in
                    making sure that there is adequate broadband or internet access in these said areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within our own South African context, we can see how the efforts are still being made, but also how
                    the lack of holistic consideration has an effect. The gap presented by the digital divide is ever
                    increasing with the state of the globe as we progress through the pandemic and tackle how to allow
                    the permeation of information, education, and social interactions in the digital space, we also need
                    to address how such advances and proposals further the gaps in access for rural populations and
                    minorities in the working and educational spheres. Although there may be hesitancies with bridging
                    these barriers, there exists multiple solutions that can minimize these fears, and create spaces of
                    access for those who are receiving the short end of the pandemic stick.
