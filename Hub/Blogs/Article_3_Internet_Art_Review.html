                    Analysis of ‘Blackness for Sale’
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘Blackness for Sale’ was a 10-day live eBay auction event by composer, and artist, Keithh Townsend
                    Obadike. In this piece, Obadike, objectified and placed his ‘blackness’ for sale on - what was
                    relatively still new at the time – an eCommerce site. The online act was removed four days after
                    receiving twelve bids while live, being deemed inappropriate by the hosting site (Driscoll, 2020).
                    What was initially a comment on the forceful nature of the rising World Wide Web (Croal, 2001),
                    became intrinsically commentative on the interaction between the virtual space and black bodies, as
                    well as the intersectionality of sex and gender, and the complexity of blackness’ history (Driscoll,
                    2020), and it’s ongoing relationship with coloniality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obadike’s online performance received various responses – some directly in question of the piece,
                    particularly in terms of the relation of value of his blackness and it’s transferability across
                    genders (Croal, 2001). Participants particularly wanted to know what other “perks” were covered by
                    the transfer of his blackness, and if there would be considerations to the cost in terms of its
                    intersectionality with sexuality and gender (Croal, 2001). In response, Obadike noted that the
                    commodification of blackness is heavily influenced by gender – and so too, it would have complicated
                    his piece to add in more context regarding these intersections (Obadike, 2001). Obadike also noted
                    that the performance’s lack of visual aids, allowed for the piece was able to be fetishized and
                    resonated with audiences differently from his other works (Obadike, 2001) – and that with the
                    inclusion and regard of gender and sex, the piece would probably not have permeated in the same way
                    (Obadike, 2001).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another aspect that Obadike commented on, was the colonial impact of the World Wide Web and how the
                    Euro-colonialist narrative (Obadike, 2001) dominated the Web and defined the position of black
                    bodies in doing so. The blatant naming of sites – such as Explorer, Navigator (at the time), and
                    even now Safari – and the way they “take you to explore” (Obadike, 2001) other sites like Amazon and
                    eBay, was already showcasing how the move into the virtual space was already moving forward to
                    re-commodify the black body (Driscoll, 2020). When questioned about how this could be impacted by
                    the historical and current happens of black people profiting from selling their own cultures,
                    Obadike states that it is, “nothing new” (Obadike, 2001), but also acknowledging, that with the
                    progression of history and current events, that there is definite complications presented because
                    blackness is no longer just being marketed to the white gaze, but to black people and other people
                    of color across the globe (Obadike, 2001).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blackness is no longer being defined by its lack of presence in the difference spheres of technology
                    and digital society (Brock, 2020). But it’s presence as a commodity has become more prevalence than
                    ever, especially with the rise of social media app, TikTok. In recent years of fame, the app has
                    become infamous for its suppressive community-based algorithm, that uplifts the commodified use of
                    blackness used by the white community for financial and fame gain, while simultaneously not giving
                    any credit to the original artists (Pruitt-Young, 2021) – of which a majority are black (McClay,
                    2021). In doing this, the app also garnered a lot of scrutiny for its extensive removal of black
                    creator content, particularly in the cases where the content pertained to racial injustice (Chen,
                    2021) – however, it had done nothing for the extensive bulling and harassment present in the
                    responses to the videos, or messages received by the black creators (Chen, 2021), or the strings of
                    racially inappropriate content of extremist and racists on the white spectrum of the app (Chen,
                    2021).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Obadike’s performative piece, the now inseparable virtual world has permeated black
                    culture (Brock, 2020), and the way in which blackness is marketed, to an extent where we no longer
                    are curious about what blackness has to offer, but rather, who using what it has to offer.
                    Day-to-day we are seeing the comparatives between different blackness’ and how its commodification
                    is different when affected by the intersections of sex, sexuality, and gender. The commodification
                    of blackness presented by Obadike’s piece (Rhizome Archive, n.d.), has become an extensive basis for
                    the profits of Web culture – not only by the social media community – but in the way it still
                    resembles the colonial past of blackness. Obadike also noted in his interview with Fusco that, the
                    Web makes it easier for the performance of whiteness – makes the same “old burnt cork blackface
                    routine easier” (Obadike, 2001), and faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Obadike was one of the first net artists to perceive and comment on the colonial nature of
                    the Web and its overpowering domination as a new resource to society, I believe that Obadike’s piece
                    was not ahead of it’s time – rather a premonition of the way the digital space now commodifies and
                    uses blackness. It showcases the early hesitancies that came with the freedom of a new, virtual and
                    uncolonized space – and the way in which the move into an inseparable space of social media and
                    physical living has recreated the relationship between blackness and profit – albeit in more than
                    just money and resources – that is directly comparable to the black body in the historically
                    colonial space.
