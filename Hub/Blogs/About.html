                    For this assignment, I believe I did adequately. I was able to approach the project quite well from
                    a theoretical and technical standpoint but did lack a lot in terms of the long-term art project.
                    Moving forward, I think that I could focus more on the development of my Internet Art and start
                    implementing the use of React.JS, as well as really showcasing more of my theoretical focus and
                    develop my overarching theme of decoloniality and start exploring more of what this means in terms
                    of code, development, and the tech industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Technical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of the technical work of my site, I believe I was able to adequately meet the brief.I do
                    believe that in terms of my Homepage contextualizing the project, I could do something more
                    versatile in my Home section, that directly relates to or maybe even is the Internet Art PIECE WHEN
                    I DEVELOP IT. However, at this stage, I think it works fine enough to show my work chronologically,
                    and to cover all the necessary components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the separate Blog and Internet Art pages, I have instead sectioned them on the homepage
                    to focus on my personal goal of a “one page” site. Outside of the separate blog pages – which I
                    eventually hope to show as pop-ups if possible – the only page I feel might really get a separate
                    page, is the Internet Art Project itself. Currently, I have not started with the development of it
                    but, I have started a section and a blog that details my plans for moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have made use of good semantic markup, metadata – although I believe I should vary it more per
                    page – and my site is responsive, except for some few elements, namely my navigation arrows on my
                    homepage. I have also used CSS quite heavily to arrange and finesse my site and used minimal JS to
                    create a more seamless responsive design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Theoretical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have included all the necessary blog posts topics but have decided to merge the technical and
                    artistic reflections into one living document that will be updated with each assignment. It details
                    all the decisions made and will elaborate more reflectively on the work done on the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my close reading and analysis, I am quite happy with my work, as I have finally started to
                    correctly reference my ideas and really involve myself with more than just the provided texts.
                    Moving forward, I would definitely like to produce more work and really make the theoretical
                    aspect/approach to my work more dominate in this project, outside of the main Internet Art
                    component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I currently believe this work is my strongest of the three marking sections
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Creative Practice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do think my website has good UI practices – but they can still be improved, especially in terms of
                    accessibility. I think the aesthetic works well, but as compared to previous site developments, I
                    was not as considerate in my design, and want to address this moving forward. I believe there might
                    be some small aesthetic changes - sizing, and the like, taken into consideration by the next
                    submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do think my website’s content is coherent and really showcases my focus on decoloniality.
                    Retrospectively, I now see the brief I have set out for my project may seem a bit detached in its
                    feminism focus lens, as compared to my analysis and readings which are more toward the
                    racial-decolonial direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not think it is a train smash, and I think the idea I am proposing could still be used in that
                    direction, with some considerations and a different focus. For my internet art, I have only recently
                    really begun to develop my idea, but have not yet made any progress on it’s development nor have I
                    really made space to see how it would resonate with my site’s aesthetic – but, noting what I
                    mentioned previously, I believe I will be making some changes to the focus of the project, and shift
                    from a gender based approach, to a more racial one that correlates more with my focus of my
                    theoretical direction.
                </p>
