                    Internet Art Proposal
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my idea this semester, I would like to do something more in line with the works of Mendi Obadike
                    and Miao Ying, and create a piece that is more internet adjacent, than directly formed on the
                    workings of the web itself. Ideally, a piece that can function without the web, but that is enhanced
                    using the web and the interactivity it provides – as in the case of Obadike’s work (Obadike M. L.,
                    2001). However, I also feel like a piece, such as Blind Spot (Ying , 2007), that works in its
                    physicality, influenced by the Web is also something interesting to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With both works, I really enjoyed the use and spin on words, and examining the way that words work
                    and affect our understanding and how the lack thereof can also limit our understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, I would like to attempt something that is both physical and digital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my project I would like to examine the lens of masculinity and use the features from Obadike’s
                    work to comment on the gender binaries that affect the idea of masculinity in the social lens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to show an image of a predominately neutral or common scene from life – such as a
                    storefront with mannequins or maybe a directory of store names or accessible services and based on
                    whether the interactor picks to be male or female, it will display only what seems to be societally
                    acceptable for them to view, approach or consider, but I want this to show a great focus on what is
                    viewed as unacceptable for men or masculine identifying bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was very stuck in developing an idea for this project, and I don’t have a lot to offer in terms of
                    the development or planning. However, I would like to pursue this idea more deeply and by the next
                    submission, I would like to have a fully functional prototype that focuses on one scene/place, and
                    that highlights the particular present binaries in that scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of having this be both digital and physical I would like to see if I can directly achieve
                    the scene of the piece through photography of a place here – which would also contextualize the
                    project into the South African context.
                </p>
