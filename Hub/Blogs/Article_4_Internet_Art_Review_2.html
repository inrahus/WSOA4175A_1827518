                    Analysis of ‘Blind Spot’
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Miao Ying’s piece, “Blind Spot”, Ying highlights concerns, and comments on the highly censored
                    state of accessible internet in her home country China. What started as scholastic research, lead to
                    the eventual creation of Ying’s physical, web affected art dictionary. Ying took on the intense task
                    of individually searching each word in the dictionary and erasing along the way the words were
                    censored and restricted by the country’s local laws. During the making of this piece, Ying aimed to
                    place a spotlight on this rigid policing and the negative effects of the state’s laws that are
                    perpetuated by communist ideals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The existence of ‘Blind Spot’ can be considered an artifact as it crosses the two temporal spaces in
                    its finality (Taylor, 2009). The dictionary itself, being a version pre-communist China, and its now
                    censored state showcasing the new acceptable discourses and language. Ying’s elaborate address of
                    this exploitation of the ideal of upholding the whole of society, also showcases the temporal shift
                    from pre- to post-communist China (Net Art Anthology, 2007). However, this shift was not just that
                    of the state, but also of the population’s acceptance of these censorship regulation, and what Ying
                    refers to as ‘self-censorship’ (ELEPHANT, 2021) – something Ying relates to Stockholm Syndrome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The annotated dictionary artwork crated by Ying was the gateway piece into her relationship with the
                    power dynamics associated with censorship (Net Art Anthology, 2007) in her home country and her
                    bridging into web art (ELEPHANT, 2021). Ying’s works in the net art sphere encase a certain
                    methodology of address and comparison. Ying states how the works begin with a “digital core”
                    (ELEPHANT, 2021) that finds relation to one of the country’s communist ideologies, and from there
                    the abstraction begins. This is easily recognizable in her work, ‘Blind Spot’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The digital core of the work, ‘Blind Spot’ would be the search engine, Google – or a search engine
                    in general. This core is something used to access information of various discourses, spheres, and
                    natures. Ying’s relation of this medium to the piece through the exploited ideal of ‘society’s best
                    interest’ (Chu, Lau, Moriah, & Schallich, 2009), is abstracted through the exploration of censorship
                    – the main way in which the interests of the whole are prioritized over the individual. Although
                    this ideal is often associated with communism, and is the offered reason for the censorship, there
                    is an extreme process behind the information that even is available for the public of China to
                    access (Chu, Lau, Moriah, & Schallich, 2009).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Ying moved away from China and to the US, there was a newfound frustration and a lot of Ying’s
                    following net artworks after ‘Blind Spot’ began to address, with the previously mentioned
                    methodology, various aspects of the way Chain’s political sphere was exploiting the ideals of
                    communism to uphold their power. Although the initial scope of Ying’s work was to explore the
                    limitations of the dynamics caused by censorship, there has also been a movement in recent works of
                    Ying to address the more holistic aspect of the digital limitations on the human experience
                    (ELEPHANT, 2021). This shift has not moved Ying from her focus on the censorship issues present in
                    China, it has instead furthered her works and allowed for a more direct address of Ying’s scope on
                    the effect of the digital control and it’s interrelation with the censorship issues in China.
