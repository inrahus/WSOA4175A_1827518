                    Tackling Decoloniality
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of decoloniality has existed for as long as coloniality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018). The two
                    are
                    so intrinsically intertwined - and despite being suppressed - decoloniality finds itself constantly
                    creeping through the gaps of history and bursting into current affairs. In terms of knowledge,
                    decoloniality finds itself a necessary opposition to the monetized industry of tertiary education
                    across
                    the globe, particularly in South Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of decoloniality, tackled through knowledge, begins with the questioning of the validity
                    of
                    existing Eurocentric and Westernized knowledge (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) and challenging the
                    detachment of
                    the known from the knower (Mbembe, 2015). By opening the geopolitical spheres - and accepting the
                    pluriversal (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) - that have long been cast aside because of the glorification of
                    western beliefs, will allow us to redefine the bounds of knowledge across the globe and cultures,
                    and in
                    doing so we create a space where coloniality’s effects on the future become less gripping (Walsh &
                    Mignolo, 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the colonial matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018), in turn, finds ways to redefine such
                    existing knowledge – when presented with its overwhelming popularity and validity - in a way that
                    promotes the view of the subjugating power and diminishes the cultures/minorities from which it
                    stems.
                    The ability of the subjugating power to “cherry-pick” the minority populations, damages the manner
                    of
                    addressing the existing validity of Western knowledge. It leaves those affected by coloniality
                    facing an
                    endless influx of antagonism without allowing for the past moments of such to be resolved (Mbembe,
                    2015). It in turn leaves the individual to address and challenge the colonial power matrix, and in
                    doing
                    so, creates radicality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the South African context, and within the tertiary sphere, we saw the fruition of such in the
                    2015
                    Rhodes Must Fall Movement (Mbembe, 2015). The unresolved and untouched happenings and effects of
                    apartheid, which were so ill-addressed – and the colonial state of the country, which was so
                    glorified –
                    toppled over with the Capetonian statue of Rhodes. With the end of complacency – stemming from the
                    increasing number of unresolved issues caused by coloniality (Mbembe, 2015) – the power of the self
                    comes into play, and each person becomes responsible for their own liberation from the colonial
                    power
                    matrix (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ability of humans to exist inter-dependently with other living organisms (Walsh & Mignolo,
                    2018),
                    can tackle decoloniality in a very holistic manner. In doing so, there has been a shift in the
                    West’s
                    power over the colonial matrix of power, and a rise in the unique position of revolutionaries across
                    history have allowed for several perspectives and reflections on the approach to decoloniality.
                    Particularly the differences between the opinions of Lorde and Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
                    2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where Lorde believes that true change cannot occur without dismantling the existing matrix of power
                    –
                    which is now upheld by the binaries of race, sex and nature (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) – Gordon &
                    Gordon
                    believe that instead of completely starting over, we should use the existing tools and create from
                    them
                    a large enough, undisputable hegemony that overturns the matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
                    Although contradictory, both these views exist in response to the advancing effects of coloniality
                    (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite both Lorde and Gordon & Gordon pose valid points, I find that their opinions very detached
                    from
                    the current African, and South African context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within our context, we find ourselves between radical Africanization (Mbembe, 2015), self-righteous
                    agreement with the perspective – and no following action - of Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
                    2018),
                    all while under the rule of the postcolonial middle class who have corruptly assimilated colonial
                    thought (Mbembe, 2015). Given the working of the colonial matrix of power, and with the
                    consideration of
                    the unresolved antagonism of Apartheid and the implications of Africanization unto the foreigner
                    (Mbembe, 2015) – I find it hard to conclude a collective way forward through the repercussions of
                    coloniality on this country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of the tertiary sphere, the movement of the view of students to consumers, and the shift
                    in
                    focus from knowledge acquirement to credit acquirement (Mbembe, 2015), the focus on Western
                    imitation
                    within the African context will only cause more antagonistic results. By moving tertiary education –
                    which has now become necessary in permeating the working world created by the capitalistic society
                    (a
                    result of colonial reach) – to a marketable product (Mbembe, 2015), tertiary institutions in South
                    Africa – and globally - hinder the progress of decoloniality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In efforts to correct or steer away from this in the South African context – with the mindset of
                    Gordon
                    & Gordon – we can, as Mbembe states, “Yes, if we fully embrace our own location in the African
                    continent
                    and stop thinking in South-Africa-centric terms”. By redefining higher learning and integrating the
                    pluriverses of Africa (Mbembe, 2015) into the tertiary sphere as a means of resignification – we can
                    nurture a holistic African house of thought, with a mastery that transcends the Anglo-American means
                    of
                    tertiary approach. By unsettling the Western idea of a single temporality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018),
                    we
                    can engage in a field of knowledge that allows for the decolonization of the self, by the self –
                    with a
                    means of channeling the radicality that stems from the oppressive antagonism of the results of
                    coloniality – not on in South Africa, but on the African continent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And although I do not know, yet, how to move forward as a whole country – addressing the higher
                    education system in the manner proposed by Mbembe – not only will allow provide the basis for such a
                    solution to - but it will also shift the balance of power away from the Western and Eurocentric
                    ideals –
                    while also allowing for the knower and known to become more closely related. The focus on
                    decolonizing,
                    and achieving accessible knowledge will allow for the pluriverse to exist, and open to
                    consideration,
                    the positions of different geo-political stances and opinions. And there, we start to see how the
                    colonial matric of power, begins to fall apart.
