                    Site Making
                </p>
                <button class="viewbtn" href="#">
                    <a href="#Pt2">
                        See Updated

                <br>
                <p>
                    For this site making, I was more focused on developing a working responsive site with more
                    theoretical focus - as compared to last year, where I really played around with colour, visuals and
                    experimented with CSS and JavaScript to create different and interesting engagement with the user
                    (Pillay, 2020). This year, I wanted to simplify the website’s aesthetic, and focus on a minimalistic
                    palette, and work more on my site content than the display. Despite the visual of the site not being
                    as important to me this time around, I have one main goal – and that is to contain most of the site
                    to a single page – the home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my goal, I would like it if everything could be done on one page – however, I will initially try
                    to cut down on excessive intermediaries – like a separate blog collections page or arts collections
                    page – and make it all accessible from the home screen. The code I used in my vis.co site (Pillay,
                    vis.co - Website Design, 2020), to section the homepage, allows for this, but I did not make such
                    good use of it, and would like to attempt it this time around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the initial design of the site, I reverted to my other site works on GitHub, and reviewed
                    what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy from my previous work. From the time of my last academic site, I
                    also made a mock homepage for a company of a relative who’s company’s site used to be quite awful,
                    to develop my skills and test out different codes and styles (Pillay, Home, 2020). I used different
                    components and code from both the TSI site and my vis.co site (Pillay, vis.co - Website Design,
                    2020) from last year, to create and change the display of my site, while also prioritizing the
                    responsivity of the site and it’s display on mobile. However, as it stands, there are some issues
                    with the mobile display – such as the directional arrows sizing, which I have yet to address, but
                    hope to before the submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another issue I am currently facing is with my full page Nav Bar – where the animation displays
                    below the whole bar, but not under each link – but when I test the responsivity on mobile view, it
                    works and when I revert to the full screen, it also suddenly works. I believe I will need to apply
                    the animation to each link individually for this to be fixed but will do so at a later stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I based this site off my two previously made sites, I did not follow the method of wireframe
                    mapping and instead used a more template-based method. Because of this, currently I am worried that
                    my site may seem too much like my site from last year. I don’t know yet how to reference correctly
                    in terms of the coding, but I hope to have done the adequate research necessary for the second
                    assignment submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of my theoretical focus, I would like to – as I have done for Tackling Decoloniality –
                    focus on engaging more with the close readings, analysis, and reflections, which I haven’t really
                    done as well before. By this, I mean to really treat each more like mini-essays and do the
                    additional work to support my points – as opposed to my previous work, which was more comparable to
                    literature reviews. I also want to fucus on referencing more correctly and really recognizing where
                    different works have influenced my positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the use of
                    React.JS - I have yet to make use of this and have, for the time begin, stuck majorly to html and
                    css for my layout and design, with a slight use of JS for the responsivity of my site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With each submission, I plan to update this document, as a more reflective piece, compared to the
                    report which I would like to tackle more objectively.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Updated (Assignment 2)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the feedback I received for my site, and especially my internet artwork, I knew that I really
                    need to re-evaluate some aspects of my site, and maybe create more of a flow to the site. This was
                    overall, secondary to me, and most of the changes in my site were results of pursuing my internet
                    artwork, and this is further discussed in my <a href="./Internet Art_1_Plan.html">Internet Art
                        Post</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In efforts to, after these artistic changes, really value my feedback, I tried to address the lack
                    of flow in my site and focus on minimal changes that would still allow me to keep my one-page site.
                    The first of which was changing my “Latest” section, to “Updated and Ongoing”, so that content would
                    not repeat in my blog section and would create more of a spacious look to my page. It also
                    benefitted my internet artwork and allowed for more of the links to be access and seen by the
                    interactors of the site, while also giving a clear direction of which works on my site I would be
                    working on continuously, and which I have deemed completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kept my “About” section the same and intending on treating it the same say I do my Site Making and
                    Internet Artwork post – as living documents that are updated with each submission. These aspects of
                    my site, unlike the content I am storing in the Blog sections are everchanging and are based on my
                    own thoughts, feelings, and the feedback I receive with each submission. I also feel that showing
                    these first on my site, allows it to be well contextualized in term of our assignment briefs. The
                    reason I chose to follow up my About section after this instead of my Blog section, is because I
                    really prefer it to be there. Although it would make sense, contextually and narratively to place it
                    right at the end of the site, I hate how it looks. That is why I have given it its own risen bubble
                    case, to show it’s break in flow, and that it is something that can be looked at later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of what I haven’t addressed or fixed on my site, this would most likely be the Nav Bar.
                    Both the underlining issue that I mentioned previously, I had no time to address, and now, with the
                    removal of the “Art” section to really implement my art idea, the spacing is very off and annoying.
                    I hope to address this swiftly by the final submission. I also want to, as I mentioned in my
                    Internet Art post, really work on the mobile scaling of the site, particularly in terms of the
                    piece. It’s a lot of playing around with responsive max widths and text sizes, so I am hoping that
                    it will not be a huge issue to tackle going forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing to talk about is the implementation of React.js. In my site, I focused mainly on use
                    of HTML and CSS because it’s what I know, and it’s what I’m good at. I have tried to follow along
                    with Andre’s tutorials, some successful and some not so successful. However, in terms of the site I
                    am presenting, I currently find no need to implement the React.js. Even in terms of my Internet Art,
                    I can achieve what I want, albeit less convenient, in a way that I understand and can explain – I
                    can’t do that with React.js yet. I am still open to the idea of implementing it and hope to maybe
                    gain insight into how it could help me tackle some of the issues I have already presented above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, minimal changes have been made to my site, but in this piece, I hope I have given more
                    insight and clarified a lot of the previously confusing decisions I made. I also hope that the
                    changes have given a better flow to the site, and that the issues I mentioned will be resolvable by
                    the time I submit the final project. In terms of React.js, I think my stance on why I haven’t
                    implemented it is clear, but moving forward, I will try to see how it can further the development of
                    my site.
