                    Site Making
                </p>

                <p>
                    For this site making, I was more focused on developing a working responsive site with more
                    theoretical focus - as compared to last year, where I really played around with colour, visuals and
                    experimented with CSS and JavaScript to create different and interesting engagement with the user
                    (Pillay, 2020). This year, I wanted to simplify the website’s aesthetic, and focus on a minimalistic
                    palette, and work more on my site content than the display. Despite the visual of the site not being
                    as important to me this time around, I have one main goal – and that is to contain most of the site
                    to a single page – the home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my goal, I would like it if everything could be done on one page – however, I will initially try
                    to cut down on excessive intermediaries – like a separate blog collections page or arts collections
                    page – and make it all accessible from the home screen. The code I used in my vis.co site (Pillay,
                    vis.co - Website Design, 2020), to section the homepage, allows for this, but I did not make such
                    good use of it, and would like to attempt it this time around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the initial design of the site, I reverted to my other site works on GitHub, and reviewed
                    what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy from my previous work. From the time of my last academic site, I
                    also made a mock homepage for a company of a relative who’s company’s site used to be quite awful,
                    to develop my skills and test out different codes and styles (Pillay, Home, 2020). I used different
                    components and code from both the TSI site and my vis.co site (Pillay, vis.co - Website Design,
                    2020) from last year, to create and change the display of my site, while also prioritizing the
                    responsivity of the site and it’s display on mobile. However, as it stands, there are some issues
                    with the mobile display – such as the directional arrows sizing, which I have yet to address, but
                    hope to before the submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another issue I am currently facing is with my full page Nav Bar – where the animation displays
                    below the whole bar, but not under each link – but when I test the responsivity on mobile view, it
                    works and when I revert to the full screen, it also suddenly works. I believe I will need to apply
                    the animation to each link individually for this to be fixed but will do so at a later stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I based this site off my two previously made sites, I did not follow the method of wireframe
                    mapping and instead used a more template-based method. Because of this, currently I am worried that
                    my site may seem too much like my site from last year. I don’t know yet how to reference correctly
                    in terms of the coding, but I hope to have done the adequate research necessary for the second
                    assignment submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of my theoretical focus, I would like to – as I have done for Tackling Decoloniality –
                    focus on engaging more with the close readings, analysis, and reflections, which I haven’t really
                    done as well before. By this, I mean to really treat each more like mini-essays and do the
                    additional work to support my points – as opposed to my previous work, which was more comparable to
                    literature reviews. I also want to fucus on referencing more correctly and really recognizing where
                    different works have influenced my positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the use of
                    React.JS - I have yet to make use of this and have, for the time begin, stuck majorly to html and
                    css for my layout and design, with a slight use of JS for the responsivity of my site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With each submission, I plan to update this document, as a more reflective piece, compared to the
                    report which I would like to tackle more objectively.
